Valid parameters are array(default), string and json.\r\n\r\n2. Time()\r\n    \r\n    Returns time in microseconds.\r\n\r\n3. Memory()\r\n    \r\n    Returns current memory usage.\r\n\r\n4. ServerLoad()\r\n    \r\n    Returns average server load in last 1, 5 and 15 minutes.\r\n\r\n5. Usage()\r\n    \r\n    Returns output of getrusage(). http://linux.die.net/man/2/getrusage\r\n\r\n6. Step('label')\r\n    \r\n    Adds a step or a checkpoint to generate reports. Input a continous string as label.\r\n\r\n7. CheckGati('step1', 'step2')\r\n    \r\n    Returns values of Time(), Memory(), Usage(), memory_get_peak_usage() between two steps with their raw keys.\r\n\r\n8. Report('step1', 'step2')\r\n    \r\n    Same as CheckGati() but returns output with more readable keys.\r\n\r\nImportant\r\n=========\r\n\r\nThis script is purely for development purpose and should not be included in production.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
